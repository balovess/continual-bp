# continual-bp
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Continual Backpropagation (CBP) algorithm. CBP aims to address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by selectively resetting less important neurons, maintaining plasticity and allowing the network to learn new tasks without drastically forgetting previous ones.
